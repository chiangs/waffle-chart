# Introduction

As an American assimilating into Norway and the way of life, I'd like to think Norwegians would be proud of me for this one: 

***Waffles are better than Pies***

```js
🧇 > 🥧
```

There, I said it...and it's true.

Pies and donuts are harder to read, take longer to evaluate and grasp the proportions and meaning behind the visualization and tend to take up more space.

So let's improve your dashboard of hard-to-read pie charts that are insufficient in truly representing proportions.

Turn your hard-to-read and unhelpful pie / donut charts into a more user-friendly waffle-chart.
