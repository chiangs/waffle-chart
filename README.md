# Introduction

As an American assimilating into Norway and the way of life, I'd like to think Norwegians would be proud of me for this one: 

***Waffles are better than Pies***

```js
üßá > ü•ß
```

There, I said it...and it's true.

Turn your hard-to-read and unhelpful pie / donut charts into a more user-friendly waffle-chart.
